                <h2 class="mb-3">Why Access Control Matters in Retail Management</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    In the fast-paced world of retail, having clear and secure access to the right information is crucial for streamlined operations and business success. Retail teams are often diverse in their roles — from sales associates and inventory managers to supervisors and executives — each requiring access to different facets of the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without proper controls, you risk information overload, confusion, and potential security breaches. Sensitive data could become accessible to unauthorized individuals, while vital information might get lost in a sea of irrelevant content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why <strong>customizable access control</strong> is a game-changer.

                <h2 class="mb-3">How iAmX’s Customizable Access Control Works</h2>
                <p>
                    iAmX empowers you to decide exactly <strong>who can access which views and features</strong>, based on each user’s roles and responsibilities within your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means you can:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Assign role-based permissions tailored to your organizational structure</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Limit sensitive data exposure to authorized personnel only</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Prevent information overload by ensuring users see only what’s relevant to their tasks</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Enhance security and compliance through controlled data access</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Adjust permissions easily as your team or business evolves</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This granular control helps create a more efficient workflow, reduces errors, and protects your business’s critical information.
