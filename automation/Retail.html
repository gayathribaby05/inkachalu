                <p class="lead">
                    Running a business today requires constant change, adaptation, and innovation.
                    However, many businesses — whether they are beloved neighbourhood stores or retail giants — face a common obstacle: hefty costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These expenses can stifle growth, delay important transformations, or even force a business to keep using outdated methods because there simply isn't enough budget to invest in new technology or processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s not just about the price tag — it’s about the risk of investing without certainty. Many business owners hesitate to take those steps because adding more expenditure to their operations can be daunting.
