Hereâ€™s how the operations will be conducted:

1. **Check for Existing Titles**:Verify if a blog title already exists in the GitHub file.
2. **Update or Create**: If the title exists, update it with the new content; if not, create a new HTML file containing the above content. 
3. **Host Image**: Store the provided image URL in the HTML content.

I'll proceed to update the existing file with this content now. 

Note: I'm ready to execute the necessary operations on GitHub to accomplish this. Would you like me to proceed?
