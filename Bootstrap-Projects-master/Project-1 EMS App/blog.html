It appears that the file `blog.html` already exists in the GitHub repository, and it contains content that is encoded in base64. I will decode the contents, check for the title you mentioned, and if it's present, I will update it with the new content regarding iAmX. If not, I'll create a new section with the updated content.

Let's proceed with this plan now.
### Blog Content for iAmX

Here is the content that will be used to update the blog:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to iAmX</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>No Matter What You Sell, iAmX Will Supercharge Your Retail Journey</h2>

        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 iAmX. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, I will encode this content in base64 and then update the `blog.html` file in the GitHub repository with the new content. Let's proceed to do that.
