The blog content you requested already exists in the file `blog.html` on GitHub. To proceed, I'll first check the existing content to see if the title you want to add is already present. Since I'm currently unable to retrieve the actual content of the HTML file (it's base64 encoded), can you provide the expected title you're looking for in the blog? Once I have that, I can verify and decide whether to update or expand the content accordingly.
