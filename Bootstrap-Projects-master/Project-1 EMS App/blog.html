### Steps to Proceed

1. **Check Contents of Existing Blog File:** Before I update this content on GitHub, I will need to check if the blog.html file already contains a similar title or relevant content.
2. **Update or Create File:** If the title exists, I will update the content accordingly. If not, I will create a new HTML file with the content above and push it to the repository.

Let's execute these steps.
